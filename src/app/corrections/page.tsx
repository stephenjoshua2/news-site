          Accuracy is central to public trust. Frontline Daily reviews credible
          correction requests and updates stories when material facts are wrong,
          incomplete, or missing necessary context.

        <h2>How to request a correction</h2>
        <p>
          Send the article title or URL, the specific sentence or claim at issue,
          the correction you believe is needed, and supporting evidence through
          the Contact Desk.
        </p>
        <h2>How corrections are handled</h2>
        <p>
          Material corrections should be made transparently. Minor spelling,
          grammar, or formatting fixes may be corrected without a public note if
          they do not affect meaning.
        </p>
        <h2>Right of reply</h2>
        <p>
          People or organizations named in reporting may contact the newsroom to
          request a fair opportunity to respond where appropriate.
